# Dota2Stats

Welcome to Dota2Stats project! This project began with extracting data from API and websites like [Liquipedia](https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Main_Page). Followed by cleaning the data and visualizing the data. Dota2Stats allow comparing between one hero and the other hero's stats such as (Health, Mana, Armor .etc). The stats are calculated as accurate as possible while including bonus attributes, innate and facet but excluding abilities and talent tree. However, there are still some differences like 1 or 0.1 due to the rounding system.
Heroes stats that are calculated along their innate and facets as follow:

- Crystal Maiden (Innate)
- Death Prophet (Innate)
- Dragon Knight (Innate)
- Drow Ranger (Innate)
- Huskar (Innate)
- Invoker (Bonus Attributes)
- Jakiro (Innate)
- Lich (Innate)
- Luna (Innate)
- Morphling (Innate)
- Ogre Magi (Innate)
- Outworld Destroyer (Innate)
- Razor (Innate)
- Sniper (Innate)
- Sven (Facet)
- Ursa (Innate)
- Void Spirit (Innate)

Good Luck and Have Fun!
